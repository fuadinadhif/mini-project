## Resend Email Service â€“ Domain Setup Guide

To use Resend for sending transactional emails (like email confirmations), you need to verify your domain. Follow the steps below to set it up.

1. Buy a Custom Domain
   Purchase a domain from a provider like Hostinger/Niagahoster/Namecheap/Namespace/etc (e.g., purwadhika.my.id).
2. Log in to Resend
   Go to: https://resend.com/domains
3. Add Your Domain
   Enter your domain (e.g., purwadhika.my.id).
4. Configure DNS Records
   After adding your domain, Resend will provide DNS records (for DKIM, SPF, and DMARC).
5. Go to DNS settingg and insert the DNS records.
6. Verify Domain
   - After entering all DNS records, return to the Resend dashboard.
   - Click "I've added the records".
   - Wait for Resend to verify your domain (may take up to 24 hours, but often much faster).
